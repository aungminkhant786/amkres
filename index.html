        <div class="aboutmediv">
            <p>
                I’m Aung Min Khant, and I’m currently studying Information Technology at Gusto University. I am in my foundation year, and I’m excited to learn more about programming and technology. I’ve always
                been interested in how computers work and how websites are built, which led me to pursue a degree in IT.

                I come from a supportive family who has always encouraged me to follow my dreams. Their belief in the importance of education has motivated me to work hard and strive for success. They’ve taught me to
                stay determined and never give up, which has been a big part of my journey.

                I have a growing interest in web development, particularly in creating websites using HTML and CSS. In the future, I’d like to explore artificial intelligence and its potential to solve real-world problems.
                My goal is to become a software developer and contribute to the tech industry with my skills.

            <p>
                I initially attended a public high school but had to leave in Grade 11 due to political circumstances. Determined to continue my education, I completed the GED program, earning my certification on August 26, 2024, with a total score of 699. Soon after, I joined Gusto College, where I am currently in my foundation year. Here, I discovered a passion for programming, finding it both challenging and rewarding as I build practical skills for a future in technology. My studies have given me a solid foundation, not only in technical knowledge but also in adaptability and critical thinking—qualities I aim to bring into my career.

        <h1>My Tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
        <div class="tributediv">
            <p>
                I really admire Cristiano Ronaldo because of his passion and hard work. Even though he might not have as much natural talent as players like Lionel Messi, Ronaldo worked really hard to become one of the best footballers in the world.

            He grew up in a small town in Portugal and faced many challenges, but he never gave up on his dreams. His story shows that success doesn’t always come from being born with talent—it comes from putting in the work and never giving up. Ronaldo’s dedication to getting better and being the best motivates me to always try my best in everything I do.

            Watching him play makes me realize that if you keep working hard, no matter what, you can achieve your goals. His journey has taught me that with enough effort, anything is possible.
